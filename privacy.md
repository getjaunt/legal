# Privacy Policy

**Last updated: February 4, 2026**

Jaunt ("we", "our", or "us") operates the Jaunt mobile application. This page informs you of our policies regarding the collection, use, and disclosure of personal information when you use our app.

## Information We Collect

### Location Data
We request access to your device's location to show events and places near you. Location data is:
- Used only while the app is open
- Sent to our servers to filter results by distance (not stored)
- Not shared with third parties

You can deny location access and the app will default to showing events in the Washington, DC area.

### Kids' Information
You may optionally add your children's profiles (name, age, birth month, and interests) to get personalized event recommendations. This information is:
- Stored securely on your device using encrypted storage
- Never shared with third parties

To filter events by age-appropriateness, we send only a general age category (e.g., "toddlers", "kids") to our servers — never your children's names, exact ages, birth months, or interests.

### Calendar Data
If you choose to add an event to your calendar, we request calendar access. This permission is only used to create the calendar entry you request. We do not read or access your existing calendar data.

### Saved Events and Places
When you save events or places, this information is stored locally on your device only.

### Analytics
We collect anonymous usage analytics via PostHog to understand how the app is used and improve the experience. This includes:
- App opens
- Events and places viewed
- Events saved
- Device platform and app version

Analytics data does not include your location, kids' information, or any personally identifiable information. We do not track you across other apps or websites.

## Information We Do NOT Collect

- Email addresses (no account required)
- Precise location history
- Kids' birthdates
- Payment information
- Contacts or photos

## Data Storage

All personal data (kids' profiles, saved events, hidden items, filter preferences) is stored locally on your device using secure storage. We do not have access to this data.

Our servers provide event and place listings only. We do not store any user-specific data on our servers.

## Third-Party Services

- **Backend servers:** Provide event and place listings. Receive your location (if permitted) and age category filters to return relevant results. No user data is stored.
- **PostHog:** Receives anonymous usage analytics (see Analytics section above). PostHog's privacy policy is available at [posthog.com/privacy](https://posthog.com/privacy).

We do not sell or share your information with third parties for advertising purposes.

## Children's Privacy

Jaunt is designed for families. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children. Kids' profile data (names, ages, interests) is stored only on your device and is never sent to our servers or third parties.

## Changes to This Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page and updating the "Last updated" date.
