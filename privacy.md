# Privacy Policy

**Last updated: February 4, 2026**

Jaunt ("we", "our", or "us") operates the Jaunt mobile application. This page informs you of our policies regarding the collection, use, and disclosure of personal information when you use our app.

## Information We Collect

### Location Data
We request access to your device's location to show events and places near you. Location data is:
- Used only while the app is open
- Sent to our servers to filter results by distance (not stored)
- Not shared with third parties

You can deny location access and the app will default to showing events in the Washington, DC area.

### Kids' Information
You may optionally add your children's profiles (name, age, birth month, and interests) to get personalized event recommendations. This information is:
- Stored securely on your device using encrypted storage
- Never shared with third parties

To filter events by age-appropriateness, we send only a general age category (e.g., "toddlers", "kids") to our servers — never your children's names, exact ages, birth months, or interests.

### Calendar Data
If you choose to add an event to your calendar, we request calendar access. This permission is only used to create the calendar entry you request. We do not read or access your existing calendar data.

### Saved Events and Places
When you save events or places, this information is stored locally on your device only.

### Analytics
We collect anonymous usage analytics via PostHog to understand how the app is used and improve the experience. This includes:
- App opens
- Events and places viewed
- Events saved
- Device platform and app version

Analytics data does not include your location, kids' information, or any personally identifiable information. We do not track you across other apps or websites.

### Crash Reporting
We use Sentry to collect anonymous crash reports and error diagnostics. This helps us identify and fix bugs. Crash reports may include:
- Device type and operating system version
- App version
- Stack traces (technical error details)

Crash reports do not include your location, kids' information, or any personally identifiable information.

## Information We Do NOT Collect

- Email addresses (no account required)
- Precise location history
- Kids' birthdates
- Payment information
- Contacts or photos

## Data Storage

All personal data (kids' profiles, saved events, hidden items, filter preferences) is stored locally on your device using secure storage. We do not have access to this data.

Our servers provide event and place listings only. We do not store any user-specific data on our servers.

## Third-Party Services

- **Backend servers:** Provide event and place listings. Receive your location (if permitted) and age category filters to return relevant results. No user data is stored.
- **PostHog:** Receives anonymous usage analytics (see Analytics section above). PostHog's privacy policy is available at [posthog.com/privacy](https://posthog.com/privacy).
- **Sentry:** Receives anonymous crash reports and error diagnostics (see Crash Reporting section above). Sentry's privacy policy is available at [sentry.io/privacy](https://sentry.io/privacy/).

We do not sell or share your information with third parties for advertising purposes.

## Children's Privacy

Jaunt is designed for use by parents and caregivers. The App is not intended to be operated by children. Parents and caregivers enter their children's profile information (names, ages, interests) themselves. This data is stored only on your device and is never sent to our servers or third parties.

We do not knowingly collect personal information directly from children under 13. If you believe a child has provided us with personal information, please contact us and we will delete it promptly.

## Data Retention

Data stored on your device (children's profiles, saved events, preferences) remains until you delete it or uninstall the App.

For third-party services that process anonymous data on our behalf:
- **PostHog (analytics):** Anonymous usage data is retained for up to 1 year.
- **Sentry (crash reports):** Anonymous crash and error data is retained for up to 90 days.

We do not store any user-identifiable data on our servers.

## Changes to This Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page and updating the "Last updated" date.
