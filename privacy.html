    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p class="updated"><strong>Last updated: February 3, 2026</strong></p>

    <p>Jaunt ("we", "our", or "us") operates the Jaunt mobile application. This page informs you of our policies regarding the collection, use, and disclosure of personal information when you use our app.</p>

    <h2>Information We Collect</h2>

    <h3>Location Data</h3>
    <p>We request access to your device's location to show events and places near you. Location data is:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Used only while the app is open</li>
        <li>Not stored on our servers</li>
        <li>Not shared with third parties</li>
    </ul>
    <p>You can deny location access and the app will default to showing events in the Washington, DC area.</p>

    <h3>Kids' Information</h3>
    <p>You may optionally add your children's ages to filter events by age-appropriateness. This information is:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Stored only on your device</li>
        <li>Never transmitted to our servers</li>
        <li>Never shared with third parties</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Saved Events and Places</h3>
    <p>When you save events or places, this information is stored locally on your device only.</p>

    <h3>Analytics (Coming Soon)</h3>
    <p>We plan to collect anonymous usage analytics to understand how the app is used and improve the experience. This will include:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>App opens and session duration</li>
        <li>Features used (e.g., events viewed, searches performed)</li>
        <li>Device type and operating system</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Analytics data will not include your location, kids' information, or any personally identifiable information.</p>

    <h2>Information We Do NOT Collect</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Names or email addresses (no account required)</li>
        <li>Precise location history</li>
        <li>Kids' names or birthdates</li>
        <li>Payment information</li>
        <li>Contacts or photos</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Data Storage</h2>
    <p>All personal preferences (saved events, kids' ages, hidden items) are stored locally on your device using secure storage. We do not have access to this data.</p>
    <p>Our servers provide event and place listings only. We do not store any user-specific data on our servers.</p>

    <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>The app connects to our backend servers to fetch event and place data. We do not sell or share your information with third parties for advertising purposes.</p>

    <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
    <p>Jaunt is designed for families. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children. The "kids' ages" feature stores only ages (not names or birthdates) and this data never leaves your device.</p>

    <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page and updating the "Last updated" date.</p>

    <h2>Contact Us</h2>
    <p>If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, please contact us at:</p>
