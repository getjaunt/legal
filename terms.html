    <h1>Terms of Service</h1>
    <p class="updated"><strong>Last updated: February 4, 2026</strong></p>

    <p>Please read these Terms of Service ("Terms") carefully before using the Jaunt mobile application ("the App") operated by Jaunt ("we", "our", or "us").</p>

    <h2>Acceptance of Terms</h2>
    <p>By downloading, installing, or using the App, you agree to be bound by these Terms. If you do not agree to these Terms, do not use the App.</p>

    <h2>Description of Service</h2>
    <p>Jaunt is a free mobile application that helps families discover kid-friendly events and places in the Washington, DC area. The App provides event listings, place information, and filtering tools based on children's ages.</p>

    <h2>Use of the App</h2>
    <p>You agree to use the App only for its intended purpose of discovering family events and places. You agree not to:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Attempt to access our servers or systems in an unauthorized manner</li>
        <li>Scrape, copy, or redistribute the content displayed in the App</li>
        <li>Use the App for any unlawful purpose</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Content and Accuracy</h2>
    <p>Event listings and place information are gathered from public sources and third-party providers. We strive for accuracy but do not guarantee that all information (dates, times, prices, locations) is complete or current. Always verify event details with the venue or organizer before attending.</p>
    <p>We are not responsible for events that are cancelled, rescheduled, or misrepresented by their organizers.</p>

    <h2>No Account Required</h2>
    <p>The App does not require account creation. All personal data (children's profiles, saved events, preferences) is stored locally on your device. See our <a href="/legal/privacy.html">Privacy Policy</a> for details.</p>

    <h2>Intellectual Property</h2>
    <p>The App and its original content, features, and functionality are owned by Jaunt. Event listings may contain information from third-party sources and remain the property of their respective owners.</p>

    <h2>Calendar Integration</h2>
    <p>If you choose to add events to your device calendar, you are responsible for managing those calendar entries. We create only the entries you explicitly request.</p>

    <h2>Disclaimer of Warranties</h2>
    <p>The App is provided "as is" and "as available" without warranties of any kind, either express or implied, including but not limited to implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, and non-infringement.</p>
    <p>We do not warrant that:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>The App will be uninterrupted or error-free</li>
        <li>Event information will be accurate, complete, or current</li>
        <li>The App will meet your specific requirements</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Limitation of Liability</h2>
    <p>To the fullest extent permitted by law, Jaunt shall not be liable for any indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or punitive damages, or any loss of profits or revenues, whether incurred directly or indirectly, or any loss of data, use, goodwill, or other intangible losses resulting from:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Your use of or inability to use the App</li>
        <li>Any event information provided through the App</li>
        <li>Unauthorized access to your data</li>
        <li>Any other matter related to the App</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Changes to Terms</h2>
    <p>We may update these Terms from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Terms on this page and updating the "Last updated" date. Your continued use of the App after changes constitutes acceptance of the new Terms.</p>

    <h2>Governing Law</h2>
    <p>These Terms shall be governed by the laws of the Commonwealth of Virginia, without regard to its conflict of law provisions.</p>
