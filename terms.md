## Description of Service

Jaunt is a free mobile application that helps families discover kid-friendly events and places in the Washington, DC area. The App provides event listings, place information, and filtering tools based on children's ages.

## Content and Accuracy

Event listings and place information are gathered from public sources and third-party providers. We strive for accuracy but do not guarantee that all information (dates, times, prices, locations) is complete or current. Always verify event details with the venue or organizer before attending.

We are not responsible for events that are cancelled, rescheduled, or misrepresented by their organizers.

The App and its original content, features, and functionality are owned by Jaunt. Event listings may contain information from third-party sources and remain the property of their respective owners.

If you choose to add events to your device calendar, you are responsible for managing those calendar entries. We create only the entries you explicitly request.

## Disclaimer of Warranties

The App is provided "as is" and "as available" without warranties of any kind, either express or implied, including but not limited to implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, and non-infringement.

We do not warrant that:
